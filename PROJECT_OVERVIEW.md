# MCP Rust SDK - Project Overview

## üéØ Why MCP Rust SDK Was Created

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is transforming how AI assistants interact with external systems, but existing Rust implementations had significant limitations for production use. While the official `rmcp` SDK provides basic functionality, it was originally built for specific use cases (like Goose) rather than general-purpose applications.

**mcp-rust-sdk** was created to bridge this gap by providing a **production-ready, enterprise-grade MCP implementation** that developers can rely on for real-world applications.

## üöÄ Key Problems Solved

### 1. **Limited Transport Options**
- **Problem**: Official SDK only supports STDIO and basic SSE
- **Solution**: Full support for STDIO, HTTP with SSE, and WebSocket transports

### 2. **Missing Production Features**
- **Problem**: No session management, error recovery, or monitoring
- **Solution**: Comprehensive session management with auto-reconnection, detailed error handling, and built-in monitoring

### 3. **Poor Developer Experience**
- **Problem**: Macro-heavy API, limited documentation, few examples
- **Solution**: Intuitive APIs, extensive documentation, and 8+ complete examples

### 4. **Lack of Enterprise Readiness**
- **Problem**: Basic error handling, no validation, limited testing
- **Solution**: Comprehensive error types, JSON Schema validation, 85+ tests with benchmarking

## üîß Core Features

### **Multi-Transport Architecture**
```rust
// STDIO Transport (Process-based)
let transport = StdioServerTransport::new();

// HTTP Transport (RESTful + SSE)
let transport = HttpServerTransport::new("0.0.0.0:3000");

// WebSocket Transport (Real-time)
let transport = WebSocketServerTransport::new("0.0.0.0:8080");
```

### **Advanced Session Management**
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection lifecycle management
- Request timeout and retry logic
- Connection pooling and load balancing

### **Production-Ready Error Handling**
```rust
match client.call_tool("my_tool".to_string(), None).await {
    Ok(result) => println!("Success: {:?}", result),
    Err(McpError::ToolNotFound(tool_name)) => {
        eprintln!("Tool '{}' not found", tool_name);
    }
    Err(McpError::ValidationError(msg)) => {
        eprintln!("Validation failed: {}", msg);
    }
    Err(McpError::Transport(msg)) => {
        eprintln!("Transport error: {}", msg);
    }
}
```

### **Comprehensive Tool System**
- Dynamic tool registration and discovery
- JSON Schema validation for parameters
- Async tool execution with proper error handling
- Built-in tool examples and templates

### **Resource Management**
- URI-based resource addressing
- MIME type detection and content serving
- Resource discovery and listing
- Real-time resource update notifications

### **Prompt Template System**
- Dynamic prompt generation with parameters
- Template validation and error handling
- Built-in prompt examples
- Extensible prompt architecture

## üîÑ When NOT to Use MCP Rust SDK

### **Use Official `rmcp` Instead If:**
- Building simple prototypes or experiments
- Need minimal dependencies
- Prefer macro-driven development
- Only need basic STDIO communication
- Working on single-client applications

### **Consider Other Options If:**
- Building non-Rust applications (use language-specific SDKs)
- Need synchronous-only APIs (MCP is inherently async)
- Working with very constrained environments (embedded systems)

## üìà Migration Path

### **From Official `rmcp`:**
```rust
// Before (rmcp)
#[tool(tool_box)]
impl Calculator {
    #[tool(description = "Calculate sum")]
    async fn sum(&self, args: SumRequest) -> String { ... }
}

// After (mcp-rust-sdk)
struct Calculator;

#[async_trait]
impl ToolHandler for Calculator {
    async fn call(&self, arguments: HashMap<String, Value>) -> Result<ToolResult, McpError> { ... }
}
```

### **From Other Languages:**
- **Python**: Similar async/await patterns, direct API translation
- **TypeScript**: Comparable transport concepts, familiar JSON handling
- **Go**: Similar channel concepts for transport layer
