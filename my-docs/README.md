# Personal Documentation Folder

This folder contains personal development notes, implementation details, and other documentation that's specific to the development process but not intended for public distribution.

## Contents

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed implementation notes and development progress
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - GitHub repository setup completion notes
- `REPOSITORY_SETUP.md` - GitHub repository configuration guide
- `PERSONAL_REMOVAL_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of personal information removal process
- Any other personal notes, TODO lists, or development artifacts

## Purpose

This folder is ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) to keep personal development notes separate from the public project documentation.

## Usage

Feel free to add any personal documentation, notes, sketches, or development artifacts here. They won't be committed to the repository.
